## Game Credits and Features

### About
This game is built based on a YouTube tutorial, with additional features and modifications added by me. Below is a summary of the tutorial used and the new features incorporated into the game.

### Tutorial
I utilized a YouTube tutorial series as a foundation for this game. You can find the tutorial series [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbEeK5odE6ToYw_4W_A_Ci1oBL_i6_qh3&si=83ZK0Q0SQ8aYjsde). While I didn't follow every tutorial video, I integrated several concepts from it into the game. Some of these include:
- Data Manager for saving music and effects volume between scenes.
- Boss Scenes implementation.
- And more.

### New Features
Here are the additional features I've implemented beyond the tutorial:
- **Personal Level Design:** Custom level design created by me.
- **Restart Button:** Added a restart button in the main menu for players who wish to start the game anew without carrying over items and experience.
- **Poison Potion:** Introduced a poison potion mechanic; upon use (by pressing 'q'), enemies are poisoned, gradually losing health over time.
- **Expanded Controls:** Besides the arrow keys for movement, I've included classic WASD keys for player movement.
- **Custom Music:** Integrated my own music into the game.
- **Fall Detector:** Implemented a fall detector to recognize when the player falls into the void, allowing them to respawn at the last checkpoint.
